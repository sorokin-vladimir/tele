## [Unreleased] — Proxy support, chat-list indicators & keyboard-layout fixes

### Added

- Chat list now shows muted (dim `×`) and manual-unread (`[•]`) indicators so
  these states are visible at a glance (#117)
- Connect through a system proxy via the `ALL_PROXY` environment variable
  (SOCKS5/HTTP) (#121)

### Fixed

- Desktop notifications are no longer shown for muted chats or chats in the
  Archive folder (archived chats are now treated as muted)
- Mute/unmute performed on another device is now reflected at runtime, so muted
  chats stop notifying without needing an app restart
- Emoji reaction picker now responds to non-Latin keyboard layouts (e.g. the
  Russian `hjkl` navigation keys), matching the remap used everywhere else

## [1.2.0] - 2026-06-11 — Reliable updates and history scrolling

### Fixed

- Messages and updates keep arriving after the app has been idle for a long
  time, instead of silently stalling until restart (#119)
- Fixed history scrollback looping between two dates instead of loading older messages (#120)
